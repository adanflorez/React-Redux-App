## React-Redux App Example
This project template was built with Create React App, which provides a simple way to start React projects with no build configuration needed.

Projects built with Create-React-App include support for ES6 syntax, as well as several unofficial / not-yet-final forms of Javascript syntax such as Class Properties and JSX. See the list of language features and polyfills supported by Create-React-App for more information.
